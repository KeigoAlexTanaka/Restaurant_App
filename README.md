# YARA (Yet Another Restaurant App)

[Link](https://sleepy-anchorage-15837.herokuapp.com/) to deployed app.

This app is a project that I created to practice my skills in making API calls and creating websites in React. Throughout this project I learned how to deploy a website via Heroku and how to set up a back-end server using Express with NodeJS.

Thanks to Dave Ceddia for [tutorial](https://daveceddia.com/deploy-react-express-app-heroku/) on heroku deployment with express.

This app is powered by [Yelp Fusion API](https://www.yelp.com/fusion)
